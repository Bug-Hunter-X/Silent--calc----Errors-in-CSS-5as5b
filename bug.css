The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you have an error in your calculation, the entire property might fail silently. This can be difficult to debug because there is no specific error message.  For example, if you attempt to divide by zero, the property value will often simply be ignored.  Another case is using incorrect units in your calculation, like mixing `px` and `em` incorrectly. This can lead to unexpected results without clear indication of the error.
