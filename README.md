# Silent CSS `calc()` Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `calc()` function is powerful, but it lacks robust error handling.  Invalid calculations or unit mismatches can lead to unexpected results without any clear indication of the problem.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a solution using a more robust approach.

## Bug:

The primary issue is the lack of clear feedback when `calc()` encounters an error. This often results in the property being ignored without any console warnings or errors.

## Solution:

The best way to prevent this issue is to carefully review and thoroughly test your calculations, ensure proper unit consistency, and use a CSS linter or validator to help catch potential errors early in the development process.  Adding comments to complex calculations can also significantly improve readability and maintainability. Consider breaking down complex calculations into smaller, more manageable steps and using CSS variables to improve organization and make changes easier.
